# SHP Management Platform Roadmap

## Project Overview
The SHP Management Platform is a comprehensive web-based solution for managing clients, credentials, tasks, and website health. This roadmap outlines the development plan and progress for the project.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Deployment**: Vercel (planned)

## Development Best Practices

### Code Quality Standards
- **Always run TypeScript checks**: `npx tsc --noEmit` before committing
- **Lint compliance**: `npm run lint` must pass with zero warnings/errors
- **Dependency management**: Use `--legacy-peer-deps` for React 19 compatibility
- **Type safety**: Avoid `any` types, use proper type assertions and interfaces
- **Prisma schema alignment**: Verify enum values match schema before using
- **Import consistency**: Use exact casing for component imports (Input, Button, etc.)

### Error Prevention Strategies
- **Research latest docs**: Always check current API documentation before implementation
- **Incremental development**: Test TypeScript compilation after each significant change
- **Schema-first approach**: Define Prisma models completely before creating API routes
- **Type-safe JSON**: Use `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` for Prisma Json fields
- **Double casting**: Use `as unknown as TargetType` for complex type conversions
- **Validation first**: Implement proper input validation before database operations
